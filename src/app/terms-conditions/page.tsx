        <div className="space-y-6 text-zinc-700 leading-relaxed">
          <p>
            This section of the Terms highlights some of the risks associated with transactions in connection with digital accounts, virtual currencies, cryptographic tokens and/or other digital assets such as the Accepted Assets, digital payments services and other risks which SICASH would like you to consider before accepting these Terms and using any part of the SICASH Services. You are solely responsible for understanding and complying with any and all applicable laws, rules and regulations in connection with your acceptance of these Terms and your use of any part of the SICASH Services, including to those related to taxes or foreign currency transactions as well as reporting and disclosure obligations. To the best of the knowledge and belief of SICASH, all risk factors which are material to you in making an informed judgment to accept these Terms and use any part of the SICASH Services have been set out below. However, the list of risk factors set out below is only a non-exhaustive list for your consideration, and other risks, arising either now or in the future, could additionally be relevant and applicable to you in making an informed judgment to accept, or continue to accept, these Terms and/or use, or continue to use, the SICASH Services.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-lg font-bold text-zinc-900 mt-8">Risk of Funds Not Being Immediately Available</h3>
          <p>
            SICASH may close, suspend, or limit your access to any part of the SICASH Services (as defined below), and/or restrict your access to the Available Balance (as defined below) of your SICASH Account (as defined below) for so long as reasonably required to protect against the risk of liability if you violate, breach or fail to comply with any part of these Terms, and the Policies (as defined below). For the avoidance of doubt, SICASH may also permanently close, suspend, or limit your access to the SICASH Services if you violate, breach or fail to comply with any part of these Terms, and the Policies.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-lg font-bold text-zinc-900 mt-8">Transaction Execution Risks</h3>
          <p>
            Please note that following SICASH&apos;s receipt of your payment or transaction instruction or instruction to proceed with a transaction in connection with the Accepted Assets, SICASH will process or execute such transaction (and where applicable, also credit the relevant payment service provider or partner account with respect to fiat-denominated instructions) as quickly as the relevant payment schemes and financial networks allow (and such transaction may be completed by the next business day following the date of SICASH&apos;s receipt of your payment instruction or instructions, if the transaction is made in EUROs; however, transactions in other currencies or assets may take longer time, depending on the cut-off limitations and execution times of the payments and processing partners involved).
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-lg font-bold text-zinc-900 mt-8">Price Change Risk Associated with Using Virtual Currencies</h3>
          <p>
            Prices of virtual currencies and/or other digital assets such as the Accepted Assets (as defined below) fluctuate day by day or even hour by hour. The value of your Available Balance could surge or drop suddenly. Please note that there is a possibility that the price of virtual currencies and/or other digital assets such as the Accepted Assets could drop to zero. Prices of virtual currencies are prone to significant fluctuations, for example, due to announced proposed legislative acts, governmental restrictions, news related to cyber-crimes or other factors causing potentially excessive market enthusiasm or disproportionate loss in confidence. Prices of virtual currencies, cryptographic tokens and/or other digital assets such as the Accepted Assets can also be manipulated.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-lg font-bold text-zinc-900 mt-8">Liquidity Risk and the Nature of Virtual Currencies</h3>
          <p>
            Your SICASH Account and the Available Balance of your SICASH Account are not protected by the relevant deposit guarantee or investment indemnity schemes, either in Poland, UAE or in any other country.
          </p>
          <p>
            Virtual currencies, cryptographic tokens and/or other digital assets such as the Accepted Assets are not legal tender in Poland, or the UAE, and are not backed by any government. Unlike fiat currencies, which are regulated and backed by local governments and central banks, virtual currencies, cryptographic tokens and/or other digital assets such as the Accepted Assets are often based only on technology and user consensus. In cases of massive manipulations or market panic, central governments will not take any corrective actions or measures to achieve stability, maintain liquidity or protect the value of virtual currencies and/or other digital assets such as the Accepted Assets.
          </p>
          <p>
            There is a possibility that executed orders with respect to certain transactions with virtual currencies and/or other digital assets such as the Accepted Assets cannot be settled or may be difficult to settle, or can be completed only at significantly adverse prices depending on the market situation and/or market volume for certain virtual currencies and/or other digital assets.
          </p>
          <p>
            There is also no assurance that SICASH will continue to accept the Accepted Assets for purposes of use of the Available Balance to execute your transactions, or that our financial partners will continue to permit or accept payments with certain cryptocurrencies in the future.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-lg font-bold text-zinc-900 mt-8">Blockchain Network Risk</h3>
          <p>
            Completion of certain transactions in connection with virtual currencies and/or other digital assets such as the Accepted Assets on blockchains can be deferred for a certain period of time until an adequate number of confirmations has been received. Transactions with Accepted Assets will not be reflected in your account until the adequate number of confirmations has been received and confirmed by SICASH. There is a possibility that your Transactions may be declined or remain unconfirmed for a period of time. Transactions in connection with virtual currencies, cryptographic tokens and/or other digital assets such as the Accepted Assets may be irreversible, and, accordingly, potential losses due to fraudulent or accidental transactions may not be recoverable. Some transactions in connection with virtual currencies, cryptographic tokens and/or other digital assets such as the Accepted Assets will be deemed to be made when recorded on a public ledger, which is not necessarily the date or time when you or another party initiated the transaction.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-lg font-bold text-zinc-900 mt-8">Risk of Using External Wallet Services and Exchange Services</h3>
          <p>
            In the case where you use an external cryptocurrency wallet or a cryptocurrency wallet which is established or maintained with an exchange, custodian or another service provider where you do not have secure possession of your private keys or credentials to access such cryptocurrency wallet, you may not be able to access your virtual currencies, and/or other digital assets including the Accepted Assets. SICASH is under no obligation, and may not be able, to assist you in such a case.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-lg font-bold text-zinc-900 mt-8">Risk of Using SICASH Account</h3>
          <p>
            While SICASH is committed to high standards for maintaining the security of all private keys to the cryptocurrency wallets associated with SICASH Accounts, SICASH is not responsible and is not liable for any loss of virtual currencies, cryptographic tokens and/or other digital assets including the Accepted Assets resulting from any loss, theft, or inappropriate or unauthorized disclosure of and/or use of the private keys to the cryptocurrency wallet associated with your SICASH Account where such loss, theft, or inappropriate or unauthorized disclosure of and/or use is not within the control of SICASH. SICASH is also under no obligation to take any corrective action or measure in the event of any such loss, theft, or inappropriate or unauthorized disclosure of and/or use.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-lg font-bold text-zinc-900 mt-8">Force Majeure</h3>
          <p>
            There is a risk that your fiat or cryptocurrency transactions may be affected by system failures resulting from adverse events, natural disasters and other emergencies, as well as unforeseen significant changes in the external environment. With regards to opportunity loss (e.g. loss of opportunity to place a payment instruction, resulting in loss of profits which could have been obtained) due to occurrences such as emergency situations and Force Majeure events, SICASH is under no obligation to take any corrective action or measure.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-lg font-bold text-zinc-900 mt-8">Regulatory Uncertainty</h3>
          <p>
            The regulatory frameworks applicable to transactions in connection with virtual currencies and other digital assets are still developing and evolving. It is possible that your transactions are, or may be in the future, subject to various reporting, tax or other liabilities and obligations. Legislative and regulatory changes or actions at the country, regional (for example, in the EU or UAE) or international level may materially and adversely affect the use, transfer, exchange, and value of virtual currencies, cryptographic tokens and/or other digital assets such as the Accepted Assets.

For all other payment transactions not covered earlier in these Terms, you acknowledge that the execution time for the payment transaction will be subject to the operating rules of international payment systems and that in this case, we will not be bound by the deadlines set out in these Terms.</p>

          <p>11.7. If we do not detect a fraudulent use or misuse of your Credentials and execute a payment transaction initiated through such Credentials, including successful application of the strong authentication requirements, as the case may be, we will, except in the case of gross negligence or willful misconduct, be deemed to have validly executed the payment transaction, as if the payment transaction had been initiated by you. We will thus be released from our obligation to refund you the funds on the SICASH Account which have been used in order to execute such payment instruction.</p>

          <p>11.8. We may, at any time, reject a payment instruction submitted to us via the Services, or impose any other conditions or restrictions upon your use of the Services. The reasons for the refusal and the procedure for correcting any factual mistakes that led to the refusal will be notified to you at the latest by the end of the Business Day following the refusal. SICASH will be deemed to have satisfied this obligation if it has sent the notification of refusal within the period of execution time regardless of the date of actual receipt by you of such notification. Any notification by SICASH of a justified refusal of a payment instruction may result in you being charged a fee.</p>

          <p>11.9. SICASH may, without being obliged to do so, refuse to execute a payment instruction in any of the accepted assets or currencies:</p>

          <p>(a) if the payment instruction contains any factual error, in particular, incomplete or imprecise transactional details;</p>

          <p>(b) if you have breached any of your obligations towards SICASH under these Terms or any other agreement entered into between you and SICASH;</p>

          <p>(c) if the payment instruction does not meet the agreed form as set out in these Terms;</p>

          <p>(d) if your Available Balance is insufficient to execute a payment instruction in full;</p>

          <p>(e) if the spending limits as may have been agreed upon between you and SICASH have been reached;</p>

          <p>(f) if the payment instruction cannot be executed in full;</p>

          <p>(g) if the payment instruction has been made by a person who has no power to operate the Account;</p>

          <p>(h) if SICASH is legally or contractually obliged to freeze your Account or block transactions;</p>

          <p>(i) if SICASH suspects that the security of Service is compromised, e.g. because of a problem or technical failure or because of hacking attacks;</p>

          <p>(j) if SICASH suspects fraud (for example where it has identified suspicious transaction(s)) or has received a notification that an incident has occurred);</p>

          <p>(k) if SICASH believes that the execution of the payment transaction would be contrary to any national or foreign laws, regulations or decisions of authorities or would expose SICASH to liability risks.</p>

          <p>11.10. Should you elect to proceed with a subsequent execution of a payment instruction notwithstanding refusal thereof by SICASH, you will provide SICASH with a new payment instruction containing all the required elements. It will not be possible to correct the initial payment instruction.</p>

          <p>11.11. If a payment instruction is beyond your Account&apos;s permissible use or applicable limits, SICASH may request additional identifying information from you and must receive such information before processing the payment instruction. If you fail to provide this additional required information or documentation, the attempted transaction may be refused or suspended by SICASH, without being obliged to do so.</p>

          <p>11.12. SICASH may, at any time and to the maximum permitted by the applicable laws, regulations, rules, directions, orders and requirements, pause, refuse to process or complete any SICASH transaction initiated by you, impose limits on the value or type of such transaction or impose any other conditions or restrictions on your access to and use of the SICASH Services.</p>

          <p>11.13. It is your sole responsibility to keep track of and monitor your activity for SICASH transactions. In particular, it is your sole responsibility to ensure that your Available Balance is sufficient to cover the full amount required for a proposed transaction and all fees associated therewith which will be payable by and charged to you upon initiation of a transaction.</p>

          <p>11.14. If you attempt to initiate, or if SICASH is instructed by you to process or complete, a transaction at a time when your Available Balance is insufficient to cover the full amount required for such transaction and all fees associated therewith which will be payable by you, such transaction in most instances will be declined. However, in the event that due to a system malfunction or any other reason, such transaction is successful or completed (or partially successful or completed) notwithstanding that your Available Balance is insufficient and your Available Balance becomes negative as a result of such successful or complete transaction, you agree to reimburse SICASH, upon request, for the amount of the transaction in excess of your Available Balance in such fiat currency, Accepted Asset or any other form as may be requested by SICASH.</p>

          <p>11.15. It is your sole responsibility to confirm the list of virtual currencies, cryptographic tokens and/or other digital assets which are Accepted Assets. Any virtual currencies, cryptographic tokens and/or other digital assets other than the Accepted Assets (&quot;Unsupported Assets&quot;) which are sent to an address associated with your SICASH Account may be lost, destroyed or not returned to you. This may also include occasional distributions of crypto assets known as &quot;airdrops&quot; or &quot;cryptodust&quot;. While you may request for SICASH assistance to retrieve any such Unsupported Assets which are sent to an address associated with your SICASH Account, SICASH is under no obligation to provide such assistance. Additionally, there may be fees payable by and chargeable to you if SICASH provides any such assistance to retrieve the Unsupported Assets for return to you.</p>

          <p>11.16. If any airdrop, fork, hack, mining attack (including double-spend attacks, majority mining power attacks and &quot;selfish-mining&quot; attacks), cyber-attack, distributed denials of service, error, vulnerability, defect, flaw in programming or source code or any other occurrence resulting in a change in the structure or source code of any blockchain, any determination of whether or not to take any corrective action or measure and the type of corrective action or measure will be made at the sole and absolute discretion of the SICASH. SICASH does not bear any liability in the event that you or a third party incurs any losses as a result of any airdrop, fork, hack, mining attack (including double-spend attacks, majority mining power attacks and &quot;selfish-mining&quot; attacks), cyber-attack, distributed denials of service, error, vulnerability, defect, flaw in programming or source code or any other occurrence resulting in a change in the structure or source code of any blockchain, or lack of corrective actions or measures taken by SICASH or if SICASH decides to cease its support of Accepted Assets with the SICASH Wallet.</p>

          <p>11.17. To the maximum extent permitted by all applicable laws, regulations, rules, directions, orders and requirements, SICASH is entitled, at any time in its sole and absolute discretion, to determine and vary the types of transactions that may be carried out with your SICASH Account, the types of services offered to you, or the payment methods supported.</p>

          <p>17.1. Subject to the applicable laws, regulations, rules, directions, orders and requirements, SICASH and/or the Card Issuer may at its/their sole and absolute discretion set certain Card Limit(s) as being applicable to your use of the Card and may vary the Card Limit(s) for different types of Card Transactions.</p>

          <p>17.2. You may request for an increase or decrease of the Card Limit(s) applicable to your use of the Card. Any approval of any request for an increase shall be subject to SICASH&apos;s and the Card Issuer&apos;s determination at its sole and absolute discretion based on all of the Customer Information provided by you to SICASH. Upon receipt of any request from you to increase the Card Limit(s) applicable to your use of the Card, you shall provide to SICASH such additional Customer Information as may be requested by SICASH and/or the Card Issuer and deemed by SICASH and/or the Card Issuer to be necessary for purposes of determining whether to approve of such increase.</p>

          <p>17.3. You shall not at any time carry out or attempt to carry out such Card Transactions the aggregate value of which, or carry out a Card Transaction the value of which, will cause the Card Limit(s) applicable to your use of the Card to be exceeded without SICASH&apos;s and/or the Card Issuer&apos;s prior written approval.</p>

          <p>17.4. In calculating whether the Card Limit has been exceeded, SICASH may take into account the amount of any Card Transaction not yet deducted from your Available Balance and of any authorization given by SICASH to any person in respect of any prospective Card Transaction(s).</p>

          <p>17.5. The expiry date of the Card shall be such date as may be indicated accordingly on the front of the Card. You shall not be entitled to use the Card for any Card Transaction from the expiry date. Unless otherwise notified to you, the Card shall be renewed and a new Card will be sent to you prior to the expiry of any existing Card.</p>

          <p>17.6. SICASH and/or the Card Issuer reserves the right, at its sole and absolute discretion, not to renew a Card. In the event that SICASH and/or the Card Issuer determines not to renew a Card held in your name, SICASH and/or the Card Issuer will notify you of the same at least thirty (30) days prior to the expiry date of the Card.</p>

          <p>17.7. When you receive your card, you must activate it by securely logging into your SICASH and following the instructions.</p>

          <p>17.8. You must not make purchases that exceed the balance of funds available on your account balance. Your available balance will be reduced by the amount of each purchase you make. If any purchase takes you over your available funds or the card limits in force from time to time, the transaction will be declined.</p>

          <p>17.9. You can use the card to make purchases in-store, via the internet or over the phone. The card can be used to obtain cash through cash machines. This is not a debit card supported by a bank account and is not in any way connected to a bank account. It is also not a guarantee card, charge card or credit card. You will not earn any interest on any funds loaded on to the card.</p>

          <p>17.10. We may stop, suspend or restrict your card or PIN on reasonable grounds relating to, for example, the security of your card, card number or PIN, and the suspected unauthorized or fraudulent use of your card or PIN. SICASH will, if possible, inform you before stopping, suspending or restricting your card or PIN that SICASH intends to do so and the reasons for doing this. If SICASH is unable to do so then SICASH will inform you immediately afterwards. The requirement to inform you does not apply where it would compromise reasonable security measures or it would be unlawful to do so.</p>

          <p>17.11. SICASH is not responsible for the quality, safety, legality, or any other aspect of any goods or services purchased with the card. SICASH are not liable for the failure of any merchant to honor the card.</p>

          <p>17.13. In relation to Card Payments, you acknowledge and agree that, subject to the applicable laws, regulations, rules, directions, orders and requirements, there may be instances or circumstances in which there are time differences between:</p>

          <p>a) the time at which the relevant invoice, sales draft or other voucher or form is signed or accepted by you for any goods, services and/or other benefits rendered by a Merchant and authorization has been sought from or given by SICASH; and</p>

          <p>b) the time of actual processing and settlement of the Card Payment by SICASH, the Card Issuer and/or Mastercard for payment to such Merchant.</p>

          <p>17.14. Subject to the applicable laws, regulations, rules, directions, orders and requirements, in some instances and depending on the currencies or Assets used in relation to the Card Transactions, the time of the card authorization and the time when the card is actually charged can be different, therefore the actual amount to be deducted from your Available Balance for such Card Payment shall be the amount calculated based on such exchange rate representing the value (in the relevant fiat currency) of a unit of an Accepted Asset as may be determined by SICASH to be applicable at the time of the transaction. Such exchange rate may differ from the Applicable Exchange Rate.</p>

          <p>17.15. In relation to certain card payments, you acknowledge and agree that, subject to the applicable laws, regulations, card rules, directions, orders and requirements, there may be instances or circumstances in which there are time differences between the time of actual processing and settlement of your payment by SICASH through our financial partners, and the time listed on your transactional history statement issued to you by your bank or credit card provider.</p>

          <p>17.16. Subject to the applicable laws, regulations, rules, directions, orders and requirements, in the instances or circumstances as referred to in clause 18.1, the actual amount to be deducted from your Available Balance for such transactions will be the amount calculated based on such exchange rate representing the value (in the relevant fiat or digital currency) of a unit of an Accepted Asset as may be determined by SICASH at the time when SICASH may be processing or authorizing such transactions.</p>

You agree and accept that if SICASH is unable to debit your SICASH Account (or any payment instrument or any bank account connected thereto) for any reason, SICASH is authorized to resubmit the debit, plus any applicable fees, to any other bank account or payment instrument that you have on record with SICASH.</p>

          <p>18.8. Where a currency conversion is offered to you by a payment service provider other than SICASH (e.g. your bank or your card issuer) and you elect to instruct SICASH to proceed with such transaction on the basis of the exchange rate and charges offered to you by such service provider, SICASH will have no liability to you, and will not be responsible, for such currency conversion.</p>
