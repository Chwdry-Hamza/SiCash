          <p className="text-zinc-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            <strong>Transaction Information:</strong> When you use the SICASH Services to send funds we ask you to provide information related to that transaction. This information includes the amount and type of the transaction, other purchase/transactional details and the details pertaining to the identity of the third party. Also, when you send money, you may be asked to provide personal details to complete the transaction. Those details may also be passed on to us from your other financial service provider. We also collect in certain cases the Internet address (IP address) and other identifying information about the computer or device you use to access your SICASH account or use the SICASH Services, in order to help detect possible instances of unauthorized transactions.
          </p>

          <p className="text-zinc-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            <strong>Information About You From Third Parties:</strong> In order to protect all our customers against potential fraud, we verify the information you provide with Payment Partners and/or Credit Reference and Fraud Agencies as well as information available through internet and publicly accessible social network data. In the course of such verification, we may receive personally identifiable information about you from such services. In particular, if you use a debit or a credit card to pay into your SICASH wallet, we may conduct verification checks that the card used for the transaction has not been reported as lost or stolen.
          </p>

          <p className="text-zinc-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            If you send or receive high overall payment volumes or display inconsistent transactional patterns through the SICASH Services, or if you have a limited transactional history with us, in some circumstances we will conduct a background check on you by obtaining information about you from a credit reference or fraud agency. If you owe us money, we may conduct a credit check on you by obtaining additional information about you from a credit reference or fraud agency, to the extent permitted by law. SICASH, at its sole discretion, reserves the right to periodically retrieve and review a business and/or consumer credit report supplied by such a credit reference or fraud agency for any account, and reserves the right to close an account based on information obtained during this credit review process.

            <strong>Information About You From Other Sources:</strong> We may also collect information about you from other sources, including from other SICASH entities, other companies (subject to their privacy policies and applicable law), and from other accounts we have reason to believe you control (whether in part or in whole).
          </p>

          <p className="text-zinc-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            <strong>Additional Verification:</strong> If we cannot verify the information that you provide, or if you request a withdrawal to an account, payment instrument or digital wallet not previously used by you, we may ask you to upload or send us additional confirmations or to answer additional questions online to help verify your information.
          </p>

          <p className="text-zinc-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">

            If you are a registered SICASH user and you are sending funds to or receiving funds from an SICASH-powered account, as a part of the transaction, the name, possible profile picture, and pertinent transactional details of both sides of the transaction will be shared as a part of transaction notification. However, your card number, bank account and other financial information will not be revealed to anyone through the SICASH Services or third parties that use the SICASH Services, except with your express permission or if we are required to do so pursuant to credit card rules, a court order or other legal process. If you would like to disable the functionality of being discovered by other SICASH customers, you can do so by adjusting your profile settings.

            We work with third parties to enable them to accept or facilitate payments from or to you using the SICASH Services. In doing so, a third party may share information about you with us such as your email address or phone number, when a payment is sent to you or when you are attempting to pay that third party. We use this information to confirm that you are a SICASH customer and that SICASH can be enabled to make a payment, or where a payment is sent to you to send you a notification that you have received a payment. Also, if you request that we validate your status as a SICASH customer with a third party, we will do so. Please note that third parties you receive funds or buy from with may have their own privacy policies, and SICASH is not responsible for their operations, including but not limited to their information practices.

            Just like most banks or financial/payment service providers, SICASH works with third-party service providers and other business partners, which provide important functions to us that allow us to be an easier, faster, and safer way to buy, sell, hold and send virtual currencies. We need to disclose user data to them from time to time so that the services can be performed.

          <p className="text-zinc-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            SICASH will not sell or rent any of your personal information to third parties for their marketing purposes without your explicit consent, and will only disclose this information in the limited circumstances and for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.

You acknowledge that according to their local legislation, such entities may be subject to laws, regulations, inquiries, investigations, or orders which may require the disclosure of information to the relevant authorities of the relevant country. Your use of the SICASH Services constitutes your consent to our transfer of such information to provide you the SICASH Services.
          </p>

          <p className="text-zinc-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Specifically, you consent to and direct SICASH to do any and all of the following with your information:</p>

          <ul className="text-zinc-700 leading-relaxed space-y-4 mb-6">
            <li>&#8226; Disclose necessary information to: the police and other law enforcement agencies; security forces; competent governmental, intergovernmental or supranational bodies; competent agencies, departments, regulatory authorities, self-regulatory authorities or organisations and other third parties, including SICASH Group companies, that (i) we are legally compelled and permitted to comply with, including but without limitation the US Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (&quot;FATCA Law&quot;) and the OECD common reporting standard regulations (&quot;CRS Regulations&quot;); (ii) we have reason to believe it is appropriate for us to cooperate with in investigations of fraud or other illegal activity or potential illegal activity, or (iii) to conduct investigations of violations of our User Agreement (including without limitation, your funding source or credit or debit card provider).</li>
            <li>&#8226; If you are covered by the FATCA or CRS, we are required to give you notice of the information about you that we may transfer to various authorities.</li>
            <li>&#8226; We and other organisations, including our partner banks that accept a SICASH integration, may also share, access and use (including from other countries) necessary information (including without limitation the information recorded by fraud prevention agencies) to help us and them assess and manage risk (including, without limitation, to prevent fraud, money laundering and terrorist financing). Please contact us if you want to receive further details of the relevant fraud prevention agencies.</li>
            <li>&#8226; Disclose necessary information in response to the requirements of the credit card associations or a civil or criminal legal process.</li>
            <li>&#8226; Disclose necessary information to the payment processors, auditors, customer services providers, credit reference and fraud agencies, financial products providers, commercial partners, marketing and public relations companies, operational services providers, group companies, agencies, marketplaces and other third parties listed here. The purpose of this disclosure is to allow us to provide SICASH Services to you. We also set out in the list of third parties, under each &quot;Category&quot;, non-exclusive examples of the actual third parties (which may include their assigns and successors) to whom we currently disclose your Account Information or to whom we may consider disclosing your Account Information, together with the purpose of doing so, and the actual information we disclose (except as explicitly stated, these third parties are limited by law or by contract from using the information for secondary purposes beyond the purposes for which the information was shared).</li>
            <li>&#8226; Disclose necessary information to your agent or legal representative (such as the holder of a power of attorney that you grant, or a guardian appointed for you).</li>
            <li>&#8226; Disclose aggregated statistical data with our business partners or for public relations. For example, we may disclose a specific percentage of our users living in Germany or Switzerland. However, this aggregated information is not tied to personal information.</li>
          </ul>

          <p className="text-zinc-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong>Share necessary Account Information with unaffiliated third parties for their use for the following purposes:</strong></p>
          <ul className="text-zinc-700 leading-relaxed space-y-4">
            <li>&#9675; <strong>Fraud Prevention and Risk Management:</strong> to help prevent fraud or assess and manage risk. For example, if you use the SICASH Services to buy or sell virtual currencies we may share Account Information with third parties in order to help protect your accounts from fraudulent activity, alert you if we detect such fraudulent activity on your accounts, or evaluate credit risk.</li>
            <li>&#9675; <strong>Customer Service:</strong> for customer service purposes, including to help service your accounts or resolve disputes (e.g., billing or transactional).</li>
            <li>&#9675; <strong>Legal Compliance:</strong> to help them comply with anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing verification requirements.</li>
            <li>&#9675; <strong>Service Providers:</strong> to enable service providers under contract with us to support our business operations, such as fraud prevention, bill collection, marketing, customer service and technology services. Our contracts dictate that these service providers only use your information in connection with the services they perform for us and not for their own benefit.</li>
            <li>&#9675; <strong>Mergers or Acquisitions:</strong> As with any other business, it is possible that in the future SICASH could merge with, or be acquired by, another company. If such an acquisition occurs, you consent to the successor company having access to the information maintained by SICASH, including customer Account Information, and such successor company would continue to be bound by this Privacy Policy unless and until it is amended.</li>
            <li>&#9675; <strong>Third Party Sites:</strong> If you open a SICASH account directly on a third party website or via a third party application, any information that you enter on that website or application (and not directly on a SICASH website) will be shared with the owner of the third party website or application. These sites are governed by their own privacy policies and you are encouraged to review their privacy policies before providing them with personal information. SICASH is not responsible for the content or information practices of such third parties.</li>

            SICASH is committed to handling your customer information with high standards of information security. We use computer safeguards such as firewalls and data encryption, we enforce physical access controls to our buildings and files, and we authorise access to personal information only for those employees who require it to fulfil their job responsibilities.

          <p className="text-zinc-700 leading-relaxed">
            The security of your SICASH account also relies on your protection of your SICASH password. You may not share your SICASH access credentials with anyone. SICASH representatives will never ask you for your password, so any email or other communication requesting your password should be treated as unauthorised and suspicious and forwarded to <a href="mailto:support-team@sicash.com" className="text-blue-600 hover:underline">support-team@sicash.com</a>. If you do share your SICASH password with a third party for any reason, including because the third party has promised to provide you additional services such as account aggregation, the third party will have access to your account and your personal information, and you may be responsible for actions taken using your password. If you believe someone else has obtained access to your password, please change it immediately by logging in to your account and changing your Profile settings, and also contact us right away.

            You can review the personal information you have provided to us and make any desired changes to such information, or to the settings for your SICASH account, at any time by logging in to your SICASH Account through your mobile banking app, selecting My Account, and changing your preferences. You can also close your SICASH account through your mobile banking app. If you close your SICASH account, we will mark your account in our database as &quot;Closed&quot;, but will keep your Account Information in our database. This is for instance necessary in order to deter fraud, by ensuring that persons who try to commit fraud will not be able to avoid detection simply by closing their account and opening a new account. However, if you close your SICASH account, your personally identifiable information will not be used by us for any further purposes, nor sold or shared with third parties, except as necessary to prevent fraud and assist law enforcement authorities, or as required by law.
